      <p>
        Hi, I'm Mike. In January 2024, I completed a Software Developer bootcamp
        with Northcoders and I am now on the lookout for my first role as a
        Junior Developer.
        
        I live on the Cornish coast, a stone's throw from the sea. I would love
        to hear from you if you are local to Cornwall, or if you embrace
        remote working, as I don't like to be away from my family for long!
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I have mainly focused on React development, with my Bootcamp using the
        M.E.R.N stack. However, I love learning, so am happy to turn my hand to
        other languages and technologies.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

        If you'd like to get in touch, please message me via LinkedIn.
